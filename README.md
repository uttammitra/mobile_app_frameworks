# EatApp mobile framework — v17

One repo builds **every** app in the EatApp CMS. You never edit anything here per app.

## Setup (once, ~2 minutes)

1. Create an **empty** GitHub repo and copy every file from this zip into it.
2. Commit and push. **Do not run `npm install` locally.** You do not need node_modules,
   an `.env` file, or the EAS CLI on your Mac.
3. In [expo.dev](https://expo.dev) → your project → **GitHub** → connect this repository.
   Leave **Base directory** blank (not `/`).
4. Go to the EatApp CMS → an app → **Save & Publish**. The CMS dispatches the workflow,
   Expo checks out this repo, and everything else is automatic.

That's it. No local install step exists, so there are no local dependency errors.

## Why installs used to fail

- **No `package-lock.json` is committed** (it's in `.gitignore`). EAS therefore runs
  `npm install` instead of `npm ci`, so a stale lockfile can never produce
  `npm error code EUSAGE` / `Missing: … from lock file` again.
- **`.npmrc` sets `legacy-peer-deps=true`**, which absorbs the OneSignal / expo-font
  peer conflicts that caused `ERESOLVE could not resolve`.
- Dependency versions are pinned to exactly what Expo SDK 54 expects
  (`npx expo install --check` reports "Dependencies are up to date").

## Why `expo` commands no longer crash

`app.config.js` used to throw when the CMS config wasn't reachable, which broke
`expo config`, `expo install --fix` and Expo's GitHub integration with
`No EAS project id for bundle "app.eatapp.demo"`.

It now degrades gracefully: without `EATAPP_BUNDLE_ID` it produces a valid generic
config, and it only demands an EAS project id while actually running on EAS Build.

## How a build gets its data

The CMS dispatches `.eas/workflows/build-ios.yml` / `build-android.yml` with inputs:

| input | example |
| --- | --- |
| `bundle_id` | `com.company.bkstakeaway` |
| `eas_project_id` | `30c33451-…` |
| `app_version` | `7.0.2` |
| `build_number` | `53` |

`scripts/fetch-config.js` then pulls `/api/public/apps/config` for that bundle and writes
`assets/config/app.json` plus the downloaded icon/splash images. `app.config.js` reads
those to produce the name, slug, bundle id, version, build number, permissions,
OneSignal plugin and splash screen. At runtime `src/config.ts` re-fetches the same
endpoint so content changes appear without a rebuild.

## Optional: running it locally

Only if you want the Expo Go preview:

```bash
npm install
EATAPP_BUNDLE_ID=com.company.bkstakeaway npx expo start -c
```

## Notes

- Only `app.config.js` exists — delete any leftover `app.config.ts`.
- `eas.json` pins Node `20.19.4` and iOS image `latest` (Xcode 26) so App Store Connect
  stops rejecting uploads with ITMS-90725.

## v13 changes

* **App bar is now 100% CMS-driven** — `design.template` (`appbar|tabs|drawer|none`),
  `design.showTitle`, `theme.appBar` / `theme.appBarText` (auto-contrast from
  `theme.primary`), app name/logo and every entry in
  `navigation.appBarButtons[]` (the notification bell is always first).
* **Notification centre** — new `/notifications` screen renders
  `notifications.history[]` (real OneSignal deliveries returned by the CMS),
  with relative timestamps and pull-to-refresh.
* **External links fixed** — the CMS returns external targets in `route`
  (not `url`), which previously routed to `/p/<https:/...>` and showed
  “This page is not available yet.” All navigation now goes through
  `src/nav.ts`, which opens `http(s)` targets in the in-app WebView,
  `tel:`/`mailto:`/`sms:` in the OS handler, and everything else as a page.
  `UrlView` gained cookies, pull-to-refresh, loading indicator and an
  “Open in browser” fallback.
* **Home “blank” layout** — supports `home.blank.{bg, heading, subheading,
  overlay, textPos, headingColor, subColor}` including the vertical text
  position slider and per-text colours.
* **Fonts** — `theme.fontFamily` is applied to native text (tab bar / app bar)
  and `theme.fontStack` inside every WebView, so app and dashboard match.


## v16 — linked EAS project identity

The build workflows now require and pass both `eas_project_id` and `expo_slug`.
`app.config.js` uses that authoritative slug and stops immediately when a linked
EAS build is missing it, preventing errors such as project slug `bkstakeaway`
being built with the repository fallback slug `eatapp`. Replace both files in
`.eas/workflows/` when upgrading an existing repository.


## Separate Expo projects for iOS and Android (v17)

Android often lives in its own Expo project with its **own slug and project ID**
(for example iOS `bkstakeaway`, Android `bkstakeaway-android`). EAS rejects a build
when `slug` does not match the slug of the project referenced by `extra.eas.projectId`,
which is what caused:

```
Project config: Slug for project identified by "extra.eas.projectId" (bkstakeaway)
does not match the "slug" field (eatapp).
```

### How to configure it

1. In the CMS open **App → Store & Submission → Android**.
2. Fill **Package name** (the Android application id — it may differ from the iOS bundle id).
3. Fill **Android EAS project ID (optional)** with the Expo project ID used for Android.
   Leave it empty to reuse the app-wide EAS project.
4. Click **Check slug** — the CMS asks Expo for that project and shows the real slug.
5. Save. Every Android build/submit now uses that project ID and its slug; iOS keeps
   using the app-wide project.

### What the workflow receives

| input | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bundle_id` | `apps.bundle_id` | Android **package name** |
| `eas_project_id` | app-wide EAS project | Android EAS project (falls back to app-wide) |
| `expo_slug` | slug of the iOS project | slug of the Android project |
| `app_version` / `build_number` | resolved by the CMS | resolved by the CMS |

`app.config.js` uses `EATAPP_SLUG` for `slug` and `EAS_PROJECT_ID` for
`extra.eas.projectId`, so the two always agree and the slug mismatch cannot occur.

## Android target API level (Google Play requirement)

Google Play requires apps to target **Android 16 (API level 36)** or higher.
`app.config.js` includes the `expo-build-properties` plugin which pins:

```
compileSdkVersion: 36
targetSdkVersion: 36
buildToolsVersion: '36.0.0'
minSdkVersion: 24
```

After replacing the framework, run `npm install` (adds `expo-build-properties`),
commit, push, then start a new Android build from the CMS. Test with an internal
track release before promoting to production.

## Downloading a testable APK (no Play Store)

The `preview` build profile produces an installable **APK** with internal
distribution. A dedicated workflow ships at
`.eas/workflows/build-android-apk.yml` (same inputs as `build-android.yml`,
but `profile: preview`).

From the CMS: **App → Builds → EAS live connection → Build Android APK (test)**.
When the build finishes, use the **Download** button in the Builds-on-EAS table
(or the EAS build page) to get the `.apk`, then sideload it on any Android
device (`adb install app.apk` or open the link on the phone).

Notes
- The APK is signed with the same EAS keystore, so OneSignal push and Google
  Maps work exactly as in the store build, provided your Maps API key allows
  the EAS debug/release SHA-1.
- Play Store releases keep using `build-android.yml` (`profile: production`,
  AAB).

## v20 — Android app name & icon fix

Android builds use a different application id than iOS, and the previous
build-time config sync aborted when the CMS payload reported the iOS bundle id.
That silently shipped the generic **EatApp** name and the placeholder icon.

v20 changes:

- `scripts/fetch-config.js` accepts the CMS payload when the requested id matches
  either `app.bundleId` (iOS) or the new `app.androidPackage` (Android).
- With `EATAPP_STRICT_CONFIG=1` (set by every CMS workflow) the build now **fails
  loudly** instead of falling back to the generic name/icon, including when no
  icon could be downloaded.
- `app.config.js` resolves the Android `package` from `EATAPP_ANDROID_PACKAGE` or
  `app.androidPackage` before falling back to the requested bundle id.

Upload your icon in the CMS (App → Icon) before building.
